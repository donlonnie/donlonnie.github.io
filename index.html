                my love, <br>
                when i first laid eyes on you, up until now <br>
                i have always felt this special sensation in my heart, <br>
                it was unlike anything I've ever felt. <br>
                it was warm, and cozy <br>
                i felt at times that my heart was reaching out, <br>
                reaching out of my chest just to touch your face. <br>
                and every day it has been pushing to move closer <br>
                pushing to see more of you, feel more of you. <br>
                when you hold my face when we kiss, <br>
                or when you wrap your arms tightly around me, <br>
                my heart burns itself alive, <br>
                but oddly enough it's the most pleasant experience <br>
                like a warm fireplace <br>
                or like a familar song. <br>
                my love, we are closing in on two years, <br>
                I am so excited for the many valentines
                we'll have in the future. <br>
                every day i thank god for everything he has given me: <br>
                the love of my life. <br>
                in that, he has given me everything. <br>
                i love you, my isabel, with the deepest parts of my heart <br>
                and with the weakest parts as well. <br>
                our love will guide us into eternity. <br>
                <br>
                your love, forever and ever <br>
